Collection of different algorithms, used for programming competitions (like ACM ICPC).

Contains algorithms divided by topic. Most algorithms are runnable from the file as is. 
All algorithms have a reference problem on which they can be tested (or are waiting for this problem to be provided).

Feel free to use for any purposes (you may contact authors prior, if need be).
