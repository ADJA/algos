Collection of different algorithms, used for programming competitions (like ACM ICPC).

Contains algorithms divided by topic. Most algorithms are runnable from the file as is. 
All algorithms have a reference problem on which they can be tested (or are waiting for this problem to be provided).

List of algorithms with some additional information is available at adilet.org/algos

Feel free to use for any purposes (you may contact authors before, if need be).
